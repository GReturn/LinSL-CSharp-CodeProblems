# Drawing Application
## Description
You are creating a drawing application and currently have 
only 1 tool - a pencil. You want to add brush and spray to
the drawing toolbar.

method, and class Draw, which performs pencil drawing by implementing
the IDraw interface. It outputs "Using pencil".

Complete the given Brush and Spray classes by <br>
\- inheriting them from class Draw. <br>
\- implementing the StartDraw() method for each tool, in order to output
the following: <br>
&nbsp; \- "Using brush" for Brush, or <br>

The Draw objects and their method calls are provided in Main().
