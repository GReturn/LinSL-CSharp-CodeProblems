# Social Network

## Description

You are making a social network application and want to add post creation functionality.

As a user creates a post, the text "New post" should be automatically outputted
so that then the user can add the text he/she wants to share.

The program you are given declares a <strong><em>Post</em></strong> class with a
<strong><em>text</em></strong> private field, and the <strong><em>ShowPost()</em></strong>
method which outputs the content.
Complete the class with

<ul>
    <li> a constructor, which output "New post" as called. </li>
    <li><strong><em>Text</em></strong> property, which allows you to get and set the value
of the text field. </li>
</ul>

Once you have made the changes to the program so that it works correctly, then in main,
the program will take the text of the post from the user, create a post object, assign
the taken value to the text field and output it.

#### Sample Input

Hello!

#### Sample Output

New post
Hello!

<mark>Recall the <strong><em>value</em></strong> keyword for set accessor.</mark>
