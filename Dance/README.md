# Dance

### Description

In a ballroom dancing competition, each dancer from a pair is evaluated separately,
and then their points are summed up to get the total pair of score.

The program you are given takes the names and the points of each dancer as input
and creates a <strong><em>DancerPoints</em></strong> objects for each dancer,
using the taken name and score values as parameters for constructors.

Complete the given class, using overload + operator to return as new object where
the names of dancers are in one string (see sample output) and the score is equal
to the sum of their points.

The declaration of that object and the output of its points are already written in
Main().
